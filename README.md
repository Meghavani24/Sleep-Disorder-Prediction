🛌 Sleep Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

🧠 Project Overview:

This project aims to predict the presence of sleep disorders—Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or None—based on an individual's health profile and lifestyle habits. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze various physiological and behavioral factors to build a robust predictive model that can assist in early identification and risk management of sleep-related disorders.

The goal is to support healthcare professionals by providing data-driven insights using features such as age, BMI, stress levels, physical activity, blood pressure, and more.

📊 Dataset:

The dataset includes a range of features related to an individual's:

Demographics (e.g., Age, Gender, Occupation)

Lifestyle (e.g. Physical activity)

Health Metrics (e.g., BMI, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Stress levels)

Target Variable: Sleep Disorder (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea)

🔍 Project Highlights:

Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and bivariate insights

Handling of missing values and outliers

Feature engineering with derived metrics

Multiple classification models implemented (Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Model comparison and selection of the best-performing algorithm

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python: Data manipulation and model development

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy — Data processing

Seaborn, Matplotlib — Visualizations

Scikit-learn — ML algorithms and evaluation
